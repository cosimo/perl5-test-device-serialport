Test-Device-SerialPort
======================

Test class to pretend we are working with a real device attached to serial port.
The fake object that gets created only has some methods implemented and it hasn't
the complexity of a real serial line.

For now, it does what I need...
It should be interesting to subclass it to something like
Test::Device::SerialPort::Modem or T::D::S::Gsm or something like that.
Who knows?

Lots of additional methods and some test cases added by Bill Birthisel.
It now runs under Windows in place of Win32::SerialPort as well as
under the OS's supported by Device::SerialPort (March 2010). Most of
the commonly used functions emulate as advertised.

June, 2010: Added example that syncronizes with a free-running data stream

September, 2010: Add tied filehandle support and additional examples

INSTALLATION

To install this module type the following:

   perl Makefile.PL
   make
   make test
   make install

If you don't have make, Makefile.PL also creates pure perl scripts
to test and install (mostly for Win32 users).
